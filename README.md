# Enemies

There are 5 types of enemies, each has it's own abilities and movement pattern.

## Boss

Also known as THE Boss. Has to be destroyed in order to advance a level. Very tough, has 3 different attacks: 360 barrage, triple front burst and triple on-target. 
To assert the dominance, it doesn't move (apart from cutscenes). Yelds a lot of exp and score points. Also, it blinks...

## Enemy T2

Classic mini-boss. Spawns every 3rd wave (there is a chance to spawn 2 of them). Got 360 barrage and triple on-target guns. Slow, but got a lot of HP points.
Yes, eyes are flashing (quality content right here).
Moves freely on the game screen.

## Enemy T3

It may look funny if 2 of these ships will align together, forming eyes. Ship itself has 2 attack patterns: on-target burst and 80 angle front barrage.
Moves freely on the game screen.

## Enemy T4

There are actually 3 aliens in this ship. One of them is invisible, but rumors say, it reveal itself once in awhile. Has only 1 attack (on-target type) but 
projectiles are very fast, comparing to other ships.
Moves freely on the game screen.

## Enemy T5

Nothing special here. Just a free exp. Weak ship, weak gun. Shoots only in forward direction. Spawns in the north direction.
Moves only in one direction.

![enemy-t5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75623459/157734983-70ace57e-bfd9-4e93-99d0-d46d7c15711d.gif)

## Formation T5

Every wave, there is a chance for T5-Formation to be spawned. Number of ships is random.

# Progression
There are few main progression systems: Player progression, Level progression, Wave progression
***
## Player Level

Each new player level adds modifiers to player stats (and to item-buff medkit), every few levels player advances in `TIER`, 
with new ship model, guns and significant modifiers. To level up, you need to destroy enemies and collect coins they drop on death.
The stronger the enemy, the more exp you get. Player exerience bar and level can be seen in the upper left corner. 

## Game Level 

The game starts at level 1, in order to advance, you need to destroy enemies and fill `Threat Level Bar`, which will spawn a Boss (once all remaining enemies are defeated).
Every level adds significant modifiers to enemies.

## Waves

Enemies spawn in waves, every defeated wave adds small modifiers to enemies. Every wave is being generated with random enemy types and amount of enemies.
Every 3rd wave a mini boss is spawned (T2 enemy), there is also a chance for T5 Formation to be spawned (random amount of t5 ships alligned in line).
